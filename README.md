# 👋 Hey, I’m Techdobz — Quietly Building Tools, Systems & Ideas

I’m an engineer, writer, and builder focused on **backend-first systems**, automation, and clean internal tools.  
But **Techdobz** isn’t just services — it’s a space for sharing **quiet software, thought loops, and experiments** around building, learning, and simplifying things.

> Fast builds. Local-first thinking. Async workflows. Clarity over clutter.

## 💼 What I Build

- ⚙️ **Custom Backends** — APIs, Django apps, logic layers  
- 🤖 **Automation & Scrapers** — bots, webhooks, smart triggers  
- 📊 **Dashboards & CRMs** — tools to track, filter, and ship internally  
- 🔐 **Local-First Systems** — encrypted apps, offline-first tools  
- 🧹 **One-Off Scripts** — CLI tools, schedulers, API wrappers

> I like things that just work — and keep working.
